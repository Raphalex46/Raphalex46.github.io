        <h1>La Cartoonerie - A look at creation games and their unique language</h1>
    </header>



    <div class="post-content">
        <p>In 2019, I was in the final year of my computer science bachelor and needed to
find an internship in order to get the degree. At this point, I wasn't
desperate enough to give up on finding an internship in something that
interested me.</p>
<p>At the time, I was interested in games and educational stuff, mostly related to
creation tools. This lead me to think about <em>La Cartoonerie</em>, a website for
creating and sharing cartoons which really left a mark on the childhood of many
French people of my generation.</p>
<p>This little episode led me to write this blog post, using <em>La Cartoonerie</em> as a
sort of case study to talk about <strong>creation games</strong> (I will define this term
later) and what makes them unique in my eyes. I will start by explaining
the context surrounding my re-discovery of this website, and I will compare it
to other creation games in order to highlight the defining features of creation
games which makes them so great.</p>
<h3 id="a-website-lost-to-time">A website lost to time</h3>
<p>For a little context, 2019 was the time when the world learned that support for
Adobe Flash Player in browsers was gonna get dropped, and I was wondering what
this website (which was based on Flash) had become, and how they were planning
to handle the end of Flash. After all, maybe they needed some hands to convert
the tool to HTML5? Perfect for an internship!</p>
<p>When searching for it, I stumbled upon forum posts on <em>La Cartoonerie</em>,
discussing the end of Flash, and how to deal with it. To my horror, people were
saying that the owners of the website basically went away with the key, and it
was impossible for these users to make a transition to HTML5 because they had
no access to the code, and couldn't inherit the ownership of the site.</p>
<p>Most of the users in this forum post were people who had discovered the website
when they were a child, but then kept returning to it and creating new things.
<em>La Cartoonerie</em> was evidently precious to them.
This is a sad story, but a lot of popular cartoons made on the website were
eventually exported to the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lacartoonerie/videos">Youtube
channel</a>, so those cartoons
aren't <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_media">lost media</a> (yet).</p>
<p>Despite me thinking about the website because of the end of Flash and
rediscovering <em>La Cartoonerie</em> during this specific period, this post is not
about the death of web tools and games and how to preserve them and keep them
usable in the long run. I could also write about this topic, but I'm sure
others have already said a lot of interesting things about it.</p>
<h3 id="la-cartoonerie-itself"><em>La Cartoonerie</em> itself</h3>
<p>To start, I would like to give a brief history and description of <em>La
Cartoonerie</em>. The history part is mostly for context's sake, and the
description will help me define what I mean precisely with the term <em>creation
game</em>&quot; in the next section.</p>
<p>From what I could find, <em>La Cartoonerie</em> was created in 2006 by three people
on their spare time before leaving their jobs to work on it full time<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.
They even managed to get contracts with some big french media at some point,
showing that it was quite popular<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.
Since 2010, the website has been managed by the community, and an association
named LAKASSOCIATION was created in 2017. The association still exists, but is
probably not active anymore given the death of Flash.</p>
<p>The website itself looks like a lot of browser-based multiplayer games of the
time. The interface was pretty childish but usable, I remember that you could
sometimes got some floating bills that rewarded you with in-game money when you
clicked on them.</p>

     alt="La Cartoonerie main page in 2019"
/>
<figcaption class="caption"><i>La Cartoonerie</i>'s main page in 2019.<figcaption/>
</figure>
<p>There was of course the &quot;theater&quot; where you could go watch some new popular
cartoons, or the new episode of a show you were following. In particular, I
remember a series named &quot;Lonely Vampire&quot; which you can find on Youtube<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup>. It
looks pretty cheap when watching it now, but trust me, making these animations
must have taken the author countless hours given the tools available, and when
I was a kid, I couldn't imagine ever being able to do something like that (I
still don't). I will talk about this specific aspect of <em>La Cartoonerie</em> and
creation games in general in another section.</p>
<p>But the real <strong>heart</strong> of this website was the cartoon editor. It's made with
Flash, so it is laggy, and it gets more and more laggy as you add stuff to the
scene. The user interface is a bit hard to use if you're clumsy like me, and obviously,
since all of this is targeted at children, it's pretty limited. But these
limitations are what makes everything interesting right? This is a theme that
really speaks to me and is related to my <a href="https://raphalex46.github.io/blog/these-boots/">last
post</a>. We will get to that later. To be accurate,
there actually was multiple different modes you could choose in the editor: a
simplified mode allowing everyone to make simple cartoons easily, and an
advanced mode giving more control to more experienced users.</p>
<p>Once in the editor, you could switch between different tools: the &quot;casting&quot; tool
for creating and editing characters; the &quot;sets&quot; for creating and editing backgrounds
for your cartoon; and finally, the &quot;shooting&quot; tool where the actual animation
work happened, bringing your characters and decors to life.
The animation tool was somewhat simplified, but had pretty much everything you
would expect: you could move the character's joints and change object
properties such as scale, transform, rotation, etc. Of course,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_frame">keyframes</a> could be inserted in a
timeline, and the animation engine would then do an interpolation between those
keyframes, giving us... Animations! The editor also provided you with basic
animations like walking, running, moving lips for characters, etc. For audio,
you could upload your own files or use provided sound effects and music. All
dialogue was handled with speech bubbles like in a comic, and <em>voilà</em>! That's
pretty much everything you could do in this editor.</p>

<h3 id="creation-games">Creation games</h3>
<p>Now, what is a <em>creation game</em> then?</p>
<p>I'm not using the term &quot;creative game&quot; as that could mean a game that itself is
creative. To me, creation games are centered around creation, and creating
something, be it music, animations, games, etc. is the central part. They are
often presented as games, but usually are a lot closer to actual tools.</p>
<p>Many games allow players to create. Outside of creation games, games often
include level editors. I'm thinking of <em>Super Mario Maker</em> or
<em>Portal 2</em> for example. Here, players can express themselves through the
level editor, and the community efforts always result in great levels,
enhancing the experience of everyone, and allowing players to get a
taste of what level design is like. I'm drawing a line between these
types of editors and creation games, as in this case, the creativity
of the players is always bounded by the limits and rules of the original
game. A user-made level in <em>Super Mario Maker</em> will always conform to the
rules of a <em>Mario</em> game, even if many levels are very creative and
stretch the game system to its limits. <em>Portal 2</em> is a bit more permissive,
but stays a bit limited (especially if we only consider community levels made
with the in-game editor).</p>
<p>Some games with level editors get much closer to creation games without being
full-on creation games. I would say these games (or these games' map editors)
are on the blurry frontier between normal games and creation games.
I'm thinking about real time strategy (RTS) games such as <em>Starcraft II</em> or
<em>Warcraft III</em>. These games offer map editors so complete that people actually
actually created entirely different games in them, stretching the limits of
the engine to the maximum. For instance, people made an MMORPG-style game
in the <em>Starcraft II</em> arcade<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#4">4</a></sup>, and even shooter games<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#5">5</a></sup>. The fact that
<em>DotA</em> was originally a custom map for <em>Warcraft III</em>, which eventually
gave birth to the whole MOBA genre of games, is proof of the crazy
possibilities these in-game editors provide. We could also mention
<em>Couter Strike</em> which was originally a mod of <em>Half Life</em>, but since
this is a mod, I believe it's a little different to something made
entirely in an in-game editor. These games with incredibly advanced editors
close the gap to creation games, but with that said, it would
be a stretch to call them creation games, because the main focus
of these games, their goal, is not creation. These games were made
as strategy games, their whole purpose is not about creating and sharing
custom maps, even though they provide the tools to do so.</p>
<p>This brings me to actual creation games. The examples I want to take for this
section are <em>Flipnote Studio</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#6">6</a></sup> and <em>Dreams</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#7">7</a></sup>. Those are games that are
specifically centered around the act of creating stuff: flipbook-style
animations in the case of <em>Flipnote</em> (which is also a game of my childhood),
and games in the case of <em>Dreams</em>. Creations can then be shared with the
community, and even improved-on by other users in some cases. <em>La Cartoonerie</em>'s
central focus as a creation game, is on the creation of cartoons. As a
web-based creation game, I think <em>La Cartoonerie</em> is a bit more accessible
to everyone, and the user interface is less limited than with a DS screen or
a <em>Playstation</em> controller.</p>
<p>The reason I love creation games is that they allow users with no prior skills
to create music, games, art, animations, etc. But these games are different
to traditional tools because they still need to pass as games, and not just
<em>software</em>. In fact, I believe they fall on a spectrum according to how simple
or how complex they are, and how much or how little control they provide users.</p>
<h3 id="complexity-and-features-in-creation-games">Complexity and features in creation games</h3>
<p>In their quest to make creation accessible to everyone, creation games
need to determine how much or how little control and features they provide the
users. This choice is closely related to the complexity of the final tool: more
control and features means more choices to be made for the user, more menus,
more stuff to think about; less features means a simpler, but more limited tool.
In both cases, too much complexity or too much simplicity can prevent non-expert
users from making what they want. I will try to illustrate this with <em>Flipnote</em>
and <em>Dreams</em>.</p>
<p>I love <em>Flipnote</em>, but I believe it falls in the category of creation games
that are <strong>too</strong> simple. Few creation games get simpler than <em>Flipnote</em>: you
can draw with your DSi stylus, creating animation frames, you have access to
two different layers and two different colors, and that's pretty much it. No
joints, no keyframes, no other feature. This is cool, but it is so simplistic
that it pretty much reduces your ability to make a cool animation to your
ability to draw. If you can draw and animate pretty well by hand, you'll be
able to make cool animations. If you can't, you're screwed. It's just a
flipbook in the end.</p>

href="https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/feature/22886/2009-the-games-we-loved-flipnote-studio">source</a>).<figcaption/>
</figure>
<p>I haven't played <em>Dreams</em> a lot, but to me, it's the opposite. <em>Dreams</em> offers
a huge amount of features and stuff to do: you can make 3D models, music,
logic, etc. Everything needed to make a video game. For example, you don't need
to know how to code to make logic in <em>Dreams</em>: you can make logic circuits
using blocks, in a kind of visual programming language similar to <em>Scratch</em>.
It's a bit more difficult for graphics, but since everyone has to use a
<em>Playstation</em> controller, learning to make 3D models in <em>Dreams</em> becomes
a skill on its own, and that's the thing: <em>Dreams</em> contains so many
features, so many things, it offers so much control, that in order to
make something really interesting, you have to become skilled. In this
case, you don't have to become skilled in 3D modeling or programming on their
own, but you have to become good at using the <em>Dreams</em> editor itself.</p>
<p>I would say those are the two extremes of creation games: in the first case, the tool
is so simple that the limiting factor becomes the ability of users in a specific
skill like drawing; in the second case, users have to train their ability to use
the tool itself.</p>
<p>In my opinion, <em>La Cartoonerie</em> falls in a bit more balanced spot. It is closer
to <em>Dreams</em> than it is to <em>Flipnote</em>, but the tool itself is much more limited,
resulting in a much shorter learning curve. As an animation tool, it differs
from <em>Flipnote</em> by imposing its own way of making characters, backgrounds,
and animations. You could say it has its own <em>language</em>, which brings me
to my last point.</p>
<h3 id="the-language-of-a-creation-game">The language of a creation game</h3>
<p>Since creation games provide their own specific tools that the users must use,
they become kind of a unique vocabulary.</p>
<p>I explained in the last section that I believe <em>La Cartoonerie</em> sits in a sweet
spot in terms of complexity and features. This also makes its <em>language</em> the
most interesting out of our three examples. Since <em>Flipnote</em> simply relies on
the user's drawing skills for making nice animations, its language is quite
limited. The defining features of <em>Flipnote</em>'s language are probably the
limited colors and brushes available, and the audio which is always recorded
through the console's microphone. For <em>Dreams</em>, I would argue that it offers so
many features that its language is too complex. You can see that a game was
made in <em>Dreams</em> when you play it, but it's very difficult to figure out
exactly how the creator has made it. <em>La Cartoonerie</em>, sitting in the sweet
spot of complexity and features offers the most balanced language for a
creation game out of the three I presented.</p>
<p>Most people who watch movies are not movie directors, and most people who read
books are not writers themselves. However, most people watching cartoons on <em>La
Cartoonerie</em> have tried to make one themselves because it's the whole purpose
of the website. A director watching a movie will probably think about it in a
very different way compared to someone who has never touched a camera. The same
goes for these cartoons: when you know how the characters are made and how the
editor works, you can understand how the creator made certain effects, you can
get an idea of the tricks they used when they inevitably have to go beyond the
limitations of the tool. Maybe they used a built-in object from the game but
changed its color and scaled it so that it looks like something else.</p>
<p>Going back to &quot;Lonely Vampire&quot;, I don't remember details of the story or
characters, but I do remember some of the tricks used in the show. For example,
in the first episode, the main character looks at a photograph of her mother.
But the photograph is, of course, just a scaled down version of an actual
character, and since there is no way of stopping the character from blinking
automatically, the person in the photograph blinks. It looks a bit stupid, but
it's a detail that you can understand only if you played around with the editor
yourself.</p>
<figure class="centered">

<figcaption class="caption">Characters in <i>La Cartoonerie</i> automatically blink, so this character which is actually a photograph, blinks (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7TNQmVW9Pw">source</a>).<figcaption/>
</figure>
<p>The blinking character is in the end an artifact resulting from the
limitations of the editor, but these limitations are much more interesting when
they force the authors to make creative decisions to go around them. I remember
thinking &quot;wow, that must be so hard!&quot; when seeing cartoons with actual animated
fingers: since the characters have no fingers but just have a ball for a hand,
the cartoon creators had to come up with a solution which usually involved
scaled rectangles making up the phalanges.</p>

<h3 id="leaving-no-one-behind">Leaving no one behind</h3>
<p>I wanted to write this post about creation games to highlight their most
interesting aspect in my opinion: allowing everybody to create art (games,
animation, music, etc.). I wanted to show that the accomplishment of this goal
depends greatly on the subtle balance of complexity and features that are
provided in the game (or tool), this fine balance is what makes it really hard
to make a great creation game. I took <em>La Cartoonerie</em> as an example because I
believe it is (was) a well balanced creation game, but also because it's a
part of my childhood and French internet history, and I wanted to pay some sort
of homage to it. That being said, <em>Flipnote</em> and <em>Dreams</em> are great creation
games in their own right: they are pretty well balanced in the sense that they
are much easier to use for people who know nothing about game development or
animation than &quot;real&quot; animation software or &quot;real&quot; game engines. I think
<em>La Cartoonerie</em> achieves a slightly better balance, and thus is able
(in theory) to reach more people (obviously, in practice it didn't).</p>
<p>The design choices of the creation game are what lead to its specific
<em>language</em>. When the balance of features / complexity is done correctly, it
means that more people can engage in the creation tool, and the language
grows in significance and importance within the ecosystem of the game.
<em>Flipnote</em> and <em>Dreams</em> obviously have their own language as well (i.e. the
limited colors in <em>Flipnote</em>), but in the case of <em>Flipnote</em>, its simplicity
makes the language closer to the language of hand-drawn animations, while
the language of <em>Dreams</em> is specific to <em>Dreams</em>, but it's so large that
it makes it much harder to engage with.</p>
<p>In the end, creation games give us a glimpse of a world where everyone watching
a movie is a director, where everyone playing a game is a game designer. They
create a small bubble with its own language, limiting the amount of things that
can be done, but making the amount of knowledge needed for a deeper
understanding of the creations much lower than in the &quot;real world&quot;. A good
creation game leaves no one behind when it comes to their own creations and
deeper understanding of the creations of others, and that's what makes them
special.</p>
