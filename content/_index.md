# How did you find yourself here?

Hi, I'm Raphaël and you happened to stumble upon my personal website :)

## About me

I'm currently an engineer at University of Strasbourg (France), working on the
[Microcard](https://microcard.eu) European project.

This site can be for professional stuff, but also personal and
wathever-goes-through-my-mind stuff.

I'll probably write a bit about things I like, which will most likely involve
computers or music (metal of the thrash variety as you can probably guess from
the photo).

## Music

Music-wise, my favorite bands include, but are not limited to (order is not
important but number of occurences is):

- Megadeth
- Megadeth
- Megadeth
- Municipal Waste
- Gama Bomb
- MAXIMUM THE HORMONE
- Suicidal Tendencies
- Testament
- Lost Society (pre-treason)
- Gloryhammer !!1!!!!1!
