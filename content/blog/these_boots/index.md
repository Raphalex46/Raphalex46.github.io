I remember the first time I heard Megadeth's cover of "**These Boots Are Made
for Walkin'**" from their first album "**Killing Is My Business... And Business
Is Good!**".

### The song and its versions

It was the version on Spotify at the time (which has now been removed in favor
of the 2018 remaster). I was completely caught off-guard by the sudden bleeping
of the lyrics in the middle of the freaking song. I thought at first that it
was intentional, and just part of the song, as it seemed to fit with Dave
Mustaine and Megadeth's rebellious and _immature_ vibe at the time. As you will
see, I was _kind of_ right.<br/>
You can find this version [here](https://youtu.be/XiBc5LBPVck) on YouTube now
that it's been removed from Spotify. I actually recommend you listen to this
version first, before any of the other ones.

After searching for a bit, I could quickly find the actual [original
version](https://youtu.be/8nj71ciYbwoof) of the cover, with no bleeping. There
even exists a [live version on
Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/6swRltvx9tD1oMfTFoVJXN?si=5bdc5ff6c45d46a1).<br/>
For the sake of completeness, there also exists a [1987
version](https://youtu.be/BNNob42zlto) that was recorded for the movie
"[Dudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dudes_\(film\))". This is, funnily
enough, the last studio recording made by the original Megadeth line-up[^1], as
their 1988 album "**So Far, So Good... So What!**" would feature a new drummer
and a new guitarist.

The song itself is absolutely great. It's simply the original song, infused
with **Killing Is My Business** energy. I love the bass line and the raw energy
of the lead parts is pure 80s Megadeth. It's fast and raw, it's simply perfect.
The lyrics, in classic Megadeth fashion, have been altered to be more vulgar,
some would say _immature_.<br/>
This is how "_something you call love but confess_"
became "_something you call love but I call sex_", and how "_and now someone else
is getting all your best_" became "_and now someone else can kiss your ass_".

The song — especially the bleeped version — has been living rent-free in my
head ever since. I'll first explain why the bleeped version came into existence,
and then why I find it so great.

### Lee Hazlewood "controversy"

The guy who wrote the song, Lee Hazlewood, didn't find the _immature_ take to
be funny, but apparently found it "vile and offensive"[^2].<br/>

Threatened by legal action, the band didn't decide to exclude the song from
the 2002 remaster of their debut album, they also didn't decide to re-record
the song with the unaltered lyrics, or to simply mute the offending parts. <br/>
All of these options would have been perfectly fine, but this is Megadeth we're
talking about, and their choice was to make the infamous bleeped version.

They did finally re-record a version with unaltered lyrics on the 2018 remaster
of the album. They kind of managed to mix Dave Mustaine's current voice with
his 80s voice from the original recording. It's kind of weird and it kind
of works at the same time in my opinion, but let's not lose track of our main
subject here.

Even though it was the first time, it wouldn't be the only time Megadeth
created a cover featuring altered lyrics.

### Other Megadeth covers at the time
By the time Hazlewood realized that he hated the Megadeth version, Megadeth had
already done other covers in their own style in their 2nd and 3rd albums.

"**I Ain't Superstitious**", covered in "**Peace Sells... But Who's Buying?**",
is another great Megadeth-infused track, with crazy alternating guitar solos
and altered lyrics,
that the original artist — Willie Dixon — apparently found to be great[^3].

Their next album, "**So Far, So Good... So What!**", features a cover of the
**Sex Pistols** song "**Anarchy In The U.K.**", also with altered lyrics.
The altered lyrics in this one are actually a consequence of the band just
guessing the lyrics from the recording.<br/>
Even though they managed to get Steve Jones to play on the track, it didn't
stop the singer of the Sex Pistols from saying the cover was "a bunch of
rubbish"[^4]. It apparently wasn't bad enough rubbish to make them want to
take legal action against Mustaine's crew though...

I don't know why Hazlewood was so mad that he thought the cover deserved to
be wiped from existence, but I'm kind of glad that he did, as I will try to
explain.

### Why I love the censored version

I mentioned earlier that Megadeth could have chosen to do a number of things
in response to the legal threats: removing the song, muting parts of the lyrics,
changing the lyrics... And those options are actually what's often done
in music censorship. For example **Boris Vian**'s song, "**Le Déserteur**"
has had its lyrics altered, _and_ was banned for a while[^5].

They decided to bleep the altered parts of the lyrics, and I will try to
explain here why I think this is an interesting artistic decision. Keep in mind
that I don't know _precisely_ why the band chose to do things that way, this is
just my interpretation on why I find it great.

#### Protesting censorship

I think the main reason they decided to go for this approach is to make fun of
music censorship. Adding huge bleeps in the middle of a song is absolutely
ridiculous. Somehow, it's sounds even more ridiculous when it's part of the mix
like in our case (the whole track isn't censored, only the vocals). If Lee
Hazlewood thought that the cover was a perversion of the original, adding bleeps
in the middle of the lyrics doesn't seem like a way to restore its purity.
If anything, it makes the song even more _vile_.<br/>
The chorus is unchanged, which makes it pretty easy to figure out that the song
is a cover of Hazlewood's track, but the bleeps will make you wonder: "what the
hell is going on around here?", and if you search for a bit like I did, you will
find out about the story. This wouldn't have been possible with more _subtle_
types of censorship.

#### Exaggeration of vulgarity

The other reason I love the bleeps is that they manage to exacerbate the
vulgarity of the altered lyrics. Indeed, when you hear the bleeps, your mind
fills the blanks, and since bleeps are typically used to cover up quite nasty
stuff, you will almost always come to the conclusion that Dave is singing crazy
profanities.<br/>
If you're like me and you listened to the censored version first, you must
have been pretty disappointed when hearing the uncensored one, as the lyrics
aren't **that** obscene (or maybe I just have a dirty mind).<br/>
The ridiculousness of bleeps and the exaggeration of the perceived vulgarity of
the lyrics through censorship overall make this version of the song really
funny to me.

## Added depth through limitation

To conclude, maybe this is a bit of a stretch, but I'm a strong believer in the
idea that limitation is a great fuel for creation. I think this applies to art,
but also to engineering, programming, etc. For example, I'm fascinated by the
efforts that went into creating old Nintendo games like **Super Mario Bros.**,
and how the technical limitations of the consoles shaped the final products[^6].<br/>
I think you could agree that the threat of legal action constitutes a limitation
in some way: the band had to make a decision about their song, with this new
constraint. This led to the censored version, and as you've understood by
now, I believe it added a new dimension, a new depth to the track, although
I'm glad that the original cover is still around to be listened to.<br/>
I highly recommend that you check out this song if you haven't already, and also
take a listen at some of the other covers done by Megadeth! They've done
great covers of **Paranoid**, **No More Mr. Nice Guy**, and **Melt The Ice Away**
— one of my personal favorites — to cite a few.<br/>
I hope that this little blog post leaves you thinking about how censorship can
shape music and art in general, for the _better_, or (and let's be realistic,
this is most often the case) for the _worst_.
