I remember the first time I heard Megadeth's cover of "**These Boots Are Made
for Walkin'**" from their first album "**Killing Is My Business... And Business
Is Good!**".

It was the version on Spotify at the time (which has now been removed in favor
of the 2018 remaster). I was completely caught off-guard by the sudden bleeping
of the lyrics in the middle of the freaking song. I thought at first that it
was intentional, and just part of the song, as it seemed to fit with Dave
Mustaine and Megadeth's rebellious and _immature_ vibe at the time. As you will
see, I was _kind of_ right.<br/>
You can find this version [here](https://youtu.be/XiBc5LBPVck) on Youtube now
that it's been removed from Spotify.

After searching for a bit, I could quickly find the actual [original
version](https://youtu.be/8nj71ciYbwoof) of the cover, with no bleeping. There
even exists a [live version on
Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/6swRltvx9tD1oMfTFoVJXN?si=5bdc5ff6c45d46a1).<br/>
For the sake of completeness, there also exists a [1987
version](https://youtu.be/BNNob42zlto) that was recorded for the movie
"[Dudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dudes_\(film\))". This is, funnily
enough, the last studio recording made by the original Megadeth line-up[^1], as
their 1988 album "**So Far, So Good... So What!**" would feature a new drummer
and a new guitarist.

The song itself is absolutely great. It's simply the original song, infused
with **Killing Is My Business** energy. I love the bass line and the raw energy
of the lead parts is pure 80s Megadeth. It's fast and raw, it's simply perfect.
The lyrics, in classic Megadeth fashion, have been changed to be more vulgar,
some would say _immature_.<br/>
This is how "_something you call love but confess_"
became "_something you call love but I call sex_", and how "_and now someone else
is getting all your best_" became "_and now someone else can kiss your ass_".

The song — especially the bleeped version — has been living rent-free in my
head ever since. I'll first explain how the bleeped version came into existence,
and then why I find it so great.

The guy who wrote the song, Lee Hazlewood, didn't find the _immature_ take to
be funny, but apparently found it "vile and offensive"[^2].<br/>
Threatened by legal action the band decided to release the bleeped version in
the 2002 remaster of the album.

By the time Hazlewood realized that he hated the Megadeth version, Megadeth had
already done other covers in their own style in their 2nd and 3rd albums.<br/>
"**I Ain't Superstitious**", covered in "**Peace Sells **"
